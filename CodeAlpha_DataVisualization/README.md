# 📊 Task 3: Data Visualization

## 🎯 Aim
To transform raw data into visual formats such as charts and graphs in order to understand patterns, comparisons, and insights clearly.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

---

## 📁 Dataset Description
A simple student dataset containing:

- Marks (Numeric)

---

## 📌 Steps Followed

### 1. Import Required Libraries
- Pandas for data handling
- Matplotlib for plotting graphs

### 2. Create Dataset
- Student names and their marks were stored in a dictionary
- Converted into Pandas DataFrame

### 3. Visualize the Data
- Bar chart was used to compare marks of different students

### 4. Add Chart Details
- X-axis: Student Names
- Y-axis: Marks
- Title: Student Marks Comparison
